# Introduction

This repository holds the source codes of my Master Thesis. The title of my
thesis is __"Determining Population Structure in Bioinformatics Problems by
Bayesian Inference Methods"__. My supervisor was Prof. Seyed Mahmoud Taheri, and
my advisor was Dr. Seyed Morteza Amini. I defended on 21 October 2020, in front
of jury composed of:

* Prof. Seyed Mahmoud Taheri,
* Dr. Seyed Morteza Amini,
* Dr. Ali Kamandi,
* Dr. Firoozeh Rivaz (Shahid Beheshti University).


The Slides that I used is available at

Association mapping of genetic diseases is an important topic in bioinformatics
and human genome studies, which has attracted extensive research interest
during the recent years. Most disease association mapping algorithms are based
on hypothesis testing procedures that test one variant at a time. These methods
lose efficiency when the disease mutations are jointly tagged by multiple
variants, or when gene-gene interactions exist. In addition, most data sources
which used for these methods are homogeneous, and they ignore population
structure.


In this thesis, we describe a model-based clustering method for using
multi-locus genotype data to infer population structure and assign individuals
to sub-populations with variational Bayes. In this method detection of
multi-variant joint association in genome-wide case-control studies performed
by making the disease graph of each sub-population.


The proposed method has improved detection of disease related loci by
utilizing population structure in determining epistatic interactions.
